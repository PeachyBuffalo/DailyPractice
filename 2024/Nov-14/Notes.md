# Project Notes

## Overview
Real Estate Agent Search API that serves pre-scraped agent data through a Flask-based REST API. The system combines web scraping capabilities with a simple API interface to provide filtered agent information based on location parameters. Expansion of Nov-12 project.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Scraping Module**
  - `agentdatascrape.py`: Handles web parsing and agent data extraction
  - `runsearch.py`: Implements filtering logic based on search parameters
  - Data points collected: agent names, brokerages, experience, contact info, service areas

- **API Structure**
  - Built with Flask
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /health`: API health check
    - `POST /run_search`: Returns filtered agent data by city/state

- **Data Flow**
  - Scraper generates JSON files in output directory
  - API serves pre-scraped data from these files
  - Configuration managed via `config/search_params.json`

## Challenges Faced
- Managing asynchronous scraping operations
- Implementing efficient data storage and retrieval
- Handling rate limiting and request throttling
- Ensuring data freshness without live searches

## Resources Used
- Flask documentation
- Web scraping best practices guides
- Gunicorn deployment documentation
- JSON file handling tutorials

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time search capabilities
- Add data validation and sanitization
- Introduce caching mechanism
- Develop automated scraping schedule
- Add more granular search filters
- Implement user authentication
