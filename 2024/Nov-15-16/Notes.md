# Project Notes

## Overview
A text-based adventure game that showcases Python's object-oriented programming, file handling, and random event generation. The game features dynamic storytelling with multiple paths and outcomes.

## Implementation Details
- Object-oriented structure with classes for Player, Story, and GameEvents
- JSON file handling for storing game scenarios and player progress
- Random event generation using Python's random module
- Colorful terminal output using colorama library
- Save/load game functionality

## Challenges Faced
- Designing a flexible story structure that allows for multiple paths
- Implementing a save system that preserves player progress
- Balancing random events to maintain game engagement

## Resources Used
- Python documentation (random, json, typing modules)
- Colorama library documentation
- Object-oriented programming best practices
- ASCII art resources for visual elements

## Future Improvements
- Add more story branches and outcomes
- Implement a simple inventory system
- Add background music using pygame
- Create a GUI version using tkinter
- Add achievement system
