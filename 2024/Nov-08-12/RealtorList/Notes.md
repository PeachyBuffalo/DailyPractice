# Project Notes

## Overview
This project is a web scraper for Realtor.com that collects information about real estate agents in a specified city and state. It uses asynchronous programming to efficiently gather data across multiple pages.

## Implementation Details
- Uses `httpx` for async HTTP requests
- Implements pagination to scrape multiple pages
- Parses JSON data from the website's Next.js data structure
- Handles data extraction with error protection for missing fields
- Saves results in a structured JSON format

## Challenges Faced
1. Data Structure Navigation
   - Solution: Implemented safe navigation using `.get()` method with defaults
   - Added type checking for nested structures

2. Missing Data Handling
   - Solution: Added try/except blocks for optional fields
   - Implemented fallback values for missing data

3. Address Information
   - Solution: Added null checks for address fields
   - Created structured format for address data

## Resources Used
- httpx documentation: https://www.python-httpx.org/
- Parsel documentation: https://parsel.readthedocs.io/
- Python asyncio documentation
- Realtor.com website structure analysis

## Future Improvements
1. Add rate limiting to prevent potential blocking
2. Implement proxy rotation for larger scale scraping
3. Add data validation and cleaning
4. Create a command-line interface for city/state input
5. Add error recovery and resume capability
6. Implement concurrent processing for multiple cities
