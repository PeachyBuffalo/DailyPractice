# Daily Coding Practice ðŸš€

Welcome to my Daily Coding Practice repository! This is where I document my journey of continuous learning and improvement through daily coding projects.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning journal and a portfolio of my programming skills. Each day, I commit to creating a new project or solving a programming challenge to:

- Strengthen my programming fundamentals
- Explore new technologies and concepts
- Build a diverse portfolio of practical projects
- Maintain consistency in learning
- Document my progress as a developer

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each project is organized by date and contains a README and the code.
